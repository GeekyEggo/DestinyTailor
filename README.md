# Destiny Tailor

Easily discover how to get the most from your armour, and still look dapper.

## Getting started

Currently only available locally, Destiny Tailor is built in Node.js running Express as the backend server. Getting started locally is easy, here's what you'll need.

#### Prerequisites
* Node.js installed
* An API key from [Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/User/API)

#### Setup
1. `clone` the repository to a local directoy
1. Install the node and bower dependencies using `npm i`
2. Run `grunt config` to install your Bungie API key (this will only be stored locally and won't be shared)
3. Finally, `npm start` will start the site locally; default address [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## About the project

This is very much a "discovery" project; after realising it was possible via the Bungie API, I've decided to step outside of my comfort realms of .NET, and have a proper go with Node.js. Some of the technologies I've set out to experiment with include:
- [x] Node.js
- [x] Express
- [x] Grunt
- [x] Bower
- [ ] Web components
- [x] Angular
- [ ] Routing

# Destiny Tailor

Destiny Tailor is a site designed to help fellow guardian's get the most out of their hard earned gear. By using Bungie's API, Destiny Tailor is able to evaluate your equipped gear, and with a bit of number crunching, provide you with a list of available "stat profiles".

A "stat profile" is the term we use for a specific combinations of stats on your gear, e.g. choosing intellect over strength, which was introduced with Destiny year 2 items. This can proove really useful if, like us, you enjoy swapping your item stats to get the most out of them for the right situation, i.e. raiding, trials, or just a bit of casual striking.

## About the project

This is very much a "discovery" project; after realising it was possible via the Bungie API, I've decided to step outside of my comfort realms of .NET, and have a proper go with Node.js and Angular. All feedback is appreciated; both positive or ~~negative~~ *constructive*, so please feel free to contact me here, or on PSN via @GeekyEggo.
